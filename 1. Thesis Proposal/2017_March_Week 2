# Objective
write the first draft of the bachelor thesis (.hwp file in the directory 1.Thesis Proposal)

[Things I've done]
1. Chose thesis topic
  Low-Power Implementation of SVMs through reducing training data in IoT environment

2. Researched the following research papers related to the thesis topic
  a. Challenges and Opportunities in Edge Computing
  b. Low-Power and Low-Cost Implementation of SVMs for Smart Sensors
  c. A Study on Low Power Design of SVM Algorithm for IoT Environment
  d. Constructing a Support Vector Machine for Localization on a Low-End Cluster Sensor Network
  
3. Summarized the key ideas in the papers
  a. Challenges and Opportunities in Edge Computing
    • cloud-based applications employ a data centre to process large-scale analytics generated by edge devices
    • increased frequency of communication between edge devices and geographically distant cloud, limiting real-time response
    • Edge(fog, cloudlet) computing : exploring possibilities of performing computation on edge nodes(base stations, routers, 
    switches) to move some of computational load in the cloud
    • Motivation
      - Decentralized cloud and low latency computing
      - Surmounting resource limitations of front-end devices
      - Sustainable Energy Consumption
      - Dealing with data explosion and network traffic
      - Smart computation techniques
    • Challenges
      - General purpose computing on edge nodes
      - Discovering edge nodes
      - Partitioning and offloading tasks
      - Uncompromising Quality-of-Service and Experience
      - Using edge nodes publicly and securely
    • Opportunities
      - Standards, benchmarking and marketplace
      - Frameworks and languages 
      - Lightweight libraries and algorithms
      - Micro operating systems and virtualization
      - Industry-academic collaborations
  
4. Drafted outline of the thesis
  a. Challenges of Machine learning in Cloud Computing
  b. Emergence of Edge Computing and opportunities for machine learning in the edge nodes and devices
  c. Suggestion reducing training data to employ SVM algorithm in IoT nodes

[Things to do]
1. Research more on IoT and low-power and low-cost imiplmentations of SVMs
2. Correct minor mistakes in the draft based on TA's feedback
  a. add work schedule in the proposal
  b. add "title : " in front of the topic
  c. add figures to help demonstrate key concepts
  d. be consistent the language when using the terminology
  e. break down section 3.2 : SVM algorithm in more detail
  f. put references right next to the sentence where quoted
