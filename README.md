# Convolutional Neural Networks for Lung Cancer Subtype Classification
This is an implementation of on Python 3.x, Tensorflow 2.x, and Keras. The model takes an multi-modal lung CT image

The repository includes:
- Python source code of cancer subtype classification pipeline
- MATLAB source code for generating 2D joint histograms from 3D raw images
- lung cancer dataset of 2D joint histograms (.csv)
- visualize the detection pipeline at every step
- Example of training on your own dataset

Check out my bachelor's thesis: <b>Lung Cancer Subtype Deep Learning Classifier based on 2D Joint Histograms of multi-modal CTs</b>
for more details on this work.
