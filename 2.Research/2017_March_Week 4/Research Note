#Objective
Study references of lightweight libraries and algorithms in research paper "Challenges and Opportunities in Edge computing"

[Things I've done]
1. Researched the following research paper
  a. Real-time Edge Analytics for Cyber Physical Systems using Compression Rates
  
2. Summarized the key ideas in the paper
  a. Real-time Edge Analytics for Cyber Physical Systems using Compression Rates
    • Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) push processing to the edge for minimizing the latency between decision making and 
      control message reception
    • CPS is limited by the battery-powered, low-resourced devices
    • Proposed a self-adaptive scheme reducing the amount of resources required to store high sample rate data at the 
      edge and at the same time carries out initial data analytics
    • Algorithm reduces computation by 98% and data volumes by 55% while requiring only 11KB of memory at runtime
      and supports self-tuning and automatic reconfiguration as well

[Things to do]
1. research further on papers discussing machine learning in wireless sensor networks
2. research further on ideas that can reduce the energy cost without sacrificing the precision of data in IoT environment
