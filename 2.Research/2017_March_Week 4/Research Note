[Objective]
Study references of lightweight libraries and algorithms in research paper "Challenges and Opportunities in Edge computing"

[Things I've done]
1. Researched the following paper
  a. Real-time Edge Analytics for Cyber-Physical Systems using Compression Rates
  
2. Summarized the key ideas in the paper
  a. Real-time Edge Analytics for Cyber-Physical Systems using Compression Rates
    • Movement in Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) : push data processing to the edge for minimizing the latency between decision 
      making and control message reception
    • Limitations of CPS : battery-powered, low-resourced devices 
    • Drawbacks of telemetry units or Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) approaches in Water Distribution Network(WDN)
      - Drawback 1 : unrealistic real-time decision-making for control since analysis takes place in base stations/servers
      - Drawback 2 : amount of data that can be sensed and relayed for analysis in sensor nodes are bounded due to 
                     high energy consumption
    • Aim is to monitor and optimally control the water network in real-time by increasing the decision-making capacities 
      of energy-constrained sensor nodes and reducing the energy cost without sacrificing the precision of the data
    • Scheme using the compression rate to detect anomalies and outliers directly on the sensor node instead of compressing 
      raw sensor data and sending it to servers (without having to communicate via servers)
      - derived from the correlation between compression rate and data value fluctuation
      - a faster, more lightweight method
      - provides early indications of an issue which can be fed directly into the control function 
    • Proposed algorithm reduces computation by 98%, data volumes by 55%, while requiring only 11KB of memory at runtime 
      and supports self-tuning and automatic re-configuration as well

[Things to do]
1. Research further on papers discussing machine learning in Wireless Sensor Network(WSN)
2. Research on papers about Support Vector Machine(SVM) applied to Internet of Things(IoT)
